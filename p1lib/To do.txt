Commenting:
Add definition of input variables and output types. This will be done when we're doing the analysis of the project data since not all functions of the library will be used

Testing:
Check that all functions work properly

Cleaning up:
Some of these functions work only with specific data shapes as they are directly adapted from the exercices. 
These functions need to be generalised or modified to be usable with different data shapes.
