Commenting:
Add definition of input variables and outputs

Testing:
Time functions with dummy data
Check that all functions work properly

Cleaning up:
Some of these functions work only with specific data shapes as they are directly adapted from the exercices. 
These functions need to be generalised or modified to be usable with different data shapes
